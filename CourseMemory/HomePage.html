           Schwulst explained that the essence of the Internet is a large network composed of many single points. I agree that the Internet is driven better by individual websites than being driven by several large companies. Social media lives on its huge number of users bringing authoritative social appeal and first-hand information to it. However, the establishment of a website should not be linked to the number of users, but lies in the diversity of its functions and purposes. The birth and death of websites are based on human demands. The establishment of a website means that at least one person's demand is put forward, and people with the same demand can communicate and share on this platform. On the contrary, if one day this demand is forgotten or abandoned, then the website will naturally disappear with the demand. The impact of the demise of social media may be huge, but the demise of an individual website does not require anyone to bear any psychological pressure. As Schwulst said, "It's like throwing a beautiful rock into the ocean."

        </br>    From Schwulst's metaphors, I found that she was trying to encourage students to actively create websites. Therefore, she wrote these poetic metaphors. For me, the website is a wine, a sunrise at the top of the mountain, a rainbow after the rain, and a carefully cultivated rose. The creation of a website has never been easy. I think that a website is a gem awarded to all designers. Whether it is popular or not, whether its existence is meaningful in the eyes of others, it is the result of designers' long-time span learning of programming. The behaviour of the website is like how to make this gem into beautiful jewelry. It can be a ring, a bracelet, or even a crown, depending on what kind of service the designer wants its website to provide for a group of people.

                    I chose the passage "Colon, left paren", which concludes that "the Internet is the staging ground for both happiness and depression". If you make that definition more concrete, there will be two subheadings, one is that Internet users often get an opposite result, and the second is that the Internet splits our personalities. These two phenomena are somewhat abstract to comprehend, but it is uncomplicated to figure out the reason, that is, the rich sharing resources, communications, and comments on the internet force users to receive and judge enormous variety values of information at the same time, but can not help immediately remove different kinds of emotions from them. Therefore, unrestrained information output is the cause of extreme emotional transmission. Basically, I think there is some truth to this conclusion, but I believe more that the Internet is neutral and any positive or negative comments about it should be traced back to the individual users first.
<br>These artworks are a visual complement to the text and sometimes are examples of the author's ideas. In my opinion, after collecting these anecdotes and data, the author created and collected illustrations according to his own understanding, so these illustrations are very creative but in line with the author's point of view.
<br>In Figure 12, the second and third smiley faces are formed by turning 90 degrees counterclockwise from the first smiley face, which forms a vertical smiley face combination. Basically, you take a smiley face and rotate it so it's still a smiley face, but when they're put together it's a depressed expression and the face is incomplete and broken. Ironically, the title of the essay is also an Internet "smiley face" expression. I think it perfectly explains the contradiction of "happiness and depression" brought by the Internet in its corresponding passage and the "emotional split of users"
